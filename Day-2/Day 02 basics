if you want to  store data -> then not like this
same kind of data to store is in better way

create array -> store all thenames -> instead of creating multiple data inside single container

create array we need square brackets [] like this

variable called  person

let person = ["Abhishek", "Ananya", "Dhana", "Krishna", "Naveen" ]

console.log(person1)
console.log(person2)

arrays will be used when less context required
object will be used when more context required
